## 🤖 Machine Learning

The following classification algorithms were evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

After comparative evaluation, **Random Forest** was selected as the production model because it achieved the strongest overall performance on the generated dataset.

The model predicts:

- Placement Status
- Placement Probability
- Placement Readiness


## 🚀 Future Improvements

Version 2 roadmap:

- Authentication System
- Resume Analysis
- Package Prediction
- Skill Matching Visualization
- Placement Officer Dashboard
- Student Dashboard
- Docker Support
- Cloud Deployment
- Automated Model Retraining
